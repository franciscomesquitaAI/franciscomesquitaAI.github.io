## [Drowsiness Detection using YOLO](https://github.com/franciscomesquitaAI/Drowsiness-Detection)

Project focused on developing a computer vision system to detect drowsiness in individuals using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) network. By employing YOLO, a real-time object detection algorithm, the system can accurately identify facial landmarks and monitor eye movement patterns indicative of drowsiness. Leveraging machine learning techniques, such as image processing and deep neural networks, this project aims to enhance safety measures, particularly in scenarios such as driving, where drowsiness poses significant risks. The system can provide timely alerts or interventions to prevent accidents and promote vigilant behavior among users.
